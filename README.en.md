## 🎯 **How to Use the Exam System**

**Standard workflow:**
1. Launch: `./exam_master.sh`
2. Select your exam rank (02, 03, 04, 05, or 06)
3. The system will guide you through the exercises
4. Read the subject for each exercise
5. Write your solution in the appropriate `rendu/` directory
6. Validate your solution using the system's validation tools

**Tips:**
- ✅ Follow the menu prompts for guided experience
- ✅ Your progress is automatically tracked
- ✅ Each rank has exercises organized by difficulty level

## 📚 Exam Contents

### Exam Rank 02
Consists of 4 levels, each with exercises of incremental difficulty:

#### Level 1 (12 exercises)
- first_word, fizzbuzz, ft_putstr, ft_strcpy, ft_strlen, ft_swap, repeat_alpha, rev_print, rot_13, rotone, search_and_replace, ulstr

#### Level 2 (20 exercises)
- alpha_mirror, camel_to_snake, do_op, ft_atoi, ft_strcmp, ft_strcspn, ft_strdup, ft_strpbrk, ft_strspn, ft_strrev, inter, is_power_of_2, last_word, max, print_bits, reverse_bits, snake_to_camel, swap_bits, union, wdmatch

#### Level 3 (15 exercises)
- add_prime_sum, epur_str, expand_str, ft_atoi_base, ft_list_size, ft_range, ft_rrange, hidenp, lcm, paramsum, pgcd, print_hex, rstr_capitalizer, str_capitalizer, tab_mult

#### Level 4 (10 exercises)
- flood_fill, fprime, ft_itoa, ft_list_foreach, ft_list_remove_if, ft_split, rev_wstr, rostring, sort_int_tab, sort_list

### Exam Rank 03
Consists of two main exercises:
- **ft_printf**: Simplified implementation of the printf function
- **get_next_line**: Function to read lines from a file

### Exam Rank 04
Available in the `04/` directory with exercises organized by levels.

### Exam Rank 05
Consists of 2 levels with advanced C and C++ exercises:

#### Level 1 (3 exercises - C++)
- **bigint**: Implementation of an arbitrary precision integer class. Supports addition, comparison, and digit shifting (e.g., `42 << 3 == 42000`). The class stores numbers larger than SIZE_MAX without precision loss using string-based storage. Must implement operators: `+`, `+=`, `<<`, `>>`, `<<=`, `>>=`, `++`, `--`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`, and output operator `<<`.

- **vect2**: Class representing a 2-dimensional mathematical vector with integer components. Implements addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, and complete operator overloading including `[]` for component access, `<<` for output, comparison operators (`==`, `!=`), compound assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`), and increment/decrement operators (`++`, `--`). Must support expressions like `v2 = v3 + v3 * 2` and `v2 = 3 * v2`.

- **polyset**: Implementation of Set and Bag data structures using arrays and binary search trees. Create `searchable_array_bag` and `searchable_tree_bag` classes that inherit from provided `array_bag` and `tree_bag` classes, implementing the searchable_bag abstract interface. Then create a `set` class that wraps a searchable_bag to enforce set semantics (no duplicates). All classes must follow Orthodox Canonical Form with proper const-correctness.

#### Level 2 (2 exercises - C)
- **bsq**: Finds the largest square on a map while avoiding obstacles. The program reads a map from a file or stdin where the first line specifies: number of lines, empty character, obstacle character, and full character (space-separated). The program must identify and mark the biggest square possible using the "full" character. If multiple solutions exist, choose the topmost, then leftmost square. Must handle map validation and output "map error" to stderr for invalid maps.

- **game_of_life**: Simulation of Conway's Game of Life. Takes three arguments: `./life width height iterations`. Reads commands from stdin to draw the initial board configuration using a "pen" metaphor:
  - `w a s d`: move pen up, left, down, right
  - `x`: toggle pen (start/stop drawing)
  - Pen starts at top-left corner
  - Invalid commands are ignored
  - After reading all commands, simulate N iterations of Game of Life rules and output the result (alive cells as '0', dead cells as spaces).

### Exam Rank 06
Available in the `06/` directory. The system includes this rank for practice.

## 📝 Tips for the Exams

1. **Constant practice**: Try to solve each exercise multiple times until you can do it without consulting the solution.

2. **Time management**: Real exams have a time limit, so practice solving them under time pressure.

3. **Norminette**: Norminette is not enforced in the actual exam, so it's not included here.

4. **Debugging**: Learn to debug your code without a debugger (using strategic prints). At 42 campuses, you typically have Valgrind and gdb available.

5. **Memory**: Always check for memory leaks in functions that use malloc. Use valgrind to verify: `valgrind --leak-check=full ./your_program`

6. **Frequent exercises**:
   - **Rank 02**: Practice level 2 and 3 exercises extensively as they appear most frequently
   - **Rank 03**: ft_printf and get_next_line are the core exercises
   - **Rank 05**: Focus on operator overloading and proper class design

7. **C++ exercises (Rank 05)**:
   - Master operator overloading syntax
   - Understand Orthodox Canonical Form (default constructor, copy constructor, assignment operator, destructor)
   - Practice const-correctness
   - Know when to return by reference vs by value
   - Understand the difference between prefix and postfix increment/decrement

8. **Read the subject carefully**: Many students fail because they miss small details in the requirements. Read every line of the subject.
